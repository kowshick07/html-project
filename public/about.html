<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a final-year B.Sc Computer Science student with a strong interest in software development and emerging technologies. I enjoy building practical, real-world applications that solve everyday problems. My academic journey has helped me develop a solid foundation in programming, data structures, and web technologies.</p>
<p>I have worked on projects such as a Digital Lost & Found Management System, Expense Tracker Web App, and AI-based Deepfake Detection system. Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience in React, Firebase, Python, and modern development tools. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and continuously improving my technical skills.</P>
<p>Currently, I am preparing for campus placements and strengthening my problem-solving abilities by practicing data structures and algorithms. My goal is to begin my career as a software developer in a growth-oriented organization where I can contribute, learn, and evolve as a technology professional.</p>
